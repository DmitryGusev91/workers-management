remarks
----------
* Need to enter users data manualy to mongoDB (full name and max actions allowed , the rest is not needed), otherwise wont show in the users menu (in the instructions was said that you cant add users in web )
*Need to run the project from main file because of the environment variable (node .\server\main.js)

known issues
--------------
*Each HTML file have navbar code that is repeated exactly in the same way(duplocate code).

========================================================================================================================================

The project is built from two parts : server and client .  In addition it has a .env file which contains the secret session key that is needed to create token 
and check authentication.
In the server side there is a router folder which contains routers for users, shifts, employees, departments and the router that creates authentication token.
It has models folder which contains mongoDB schemas for department, employee, shift and user.
Data folder that contains a log of user actions that is recorded into a JSON.
DAL folder with js file that lets to read and write users from json and from web.
BLL folder with BLLs.

And we have a config folder that will connect the server to the mongo data base .
and a main file that will orchestrate the server and connect it to the front.
